Engineering Inspection Management System

## Running checks

Requirements: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js (version from
`frontend/.nvmrc`), and `make`.

- `make setup` installs backend and frontend dependencies.
- `make check` runs, for backend and frontend, format checks, lint,
  type checks, tests, and build, plus the frontend bundle-split
  check.
- CI runs the same `make check` on every pull request and on every
  push to `main`.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local environment variables;
  `.env` must not be committed.

## Documentation

- [Design Intents](docs/intents/README.md) (Traditional Chinese): why InspectFlow is designed the way it is — overview and architecture diagrams, design principles, key decisions and tech stack, glossary, and open questions.
